function [x3, y3, success] = kobonTriangle(x1, y1, side1, x2, y2, varargin)
    % Kobon Triangle Problem Solver
    % Given two vertices (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) of a triangle, and either:
    %   1. Two sides and an angle between them, or
    %   2. Two sides and an included angle
    % This function calculates the coordinates (x3, y3) of the third vertex.
    %
    % Input:
    %   - x1, y1: Coordinates of the first vertex
    %   - side1: Length of the side opposite the first vertex
    %   - x2, y2: Coordinates of the second vertex
    %   - varargin: Angle in radians or degrees (if specified)
    %               OR side2 (length of the side opposite the second vertex)
    %               AND angle: 'angle' or 'included angle' (optional)
    %
    % Output:
    %   - x3, y3: Coordinates of the third vertex
    %   - success: Boolean flag indicating whether the computation was successful
